Instructions:

A makefile is included which will compile the code. 

Type "make" then execute smallsh with "./smallsh"

Or compile with the following line:

gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c


This is a small shell that will run command line instructions and return the results similar to other shells, but without many of their fancier features. This shell will allow for the redirection of standard input and standard output and it will support both foreground and background processes. It will support three built in commands: exit, cd, and status. It will also support comments, which are lines beginning with the # character. It can also run existing linux commands
